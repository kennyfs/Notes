普心筆記 Chapter 7 記憶  
===  

# Three stages  

Like how computers work.  
* Encoding  
* Storage  
* Retrieval  

## Encoding  

Converting information into a useable form.  
**Pay Attention**: You have to focus on something to function well.  
**Craik** and **Lockhart**: information are processed at levels with different depths. deep -> longer lasting  
* Structural: Appearance.  
* Phonemic: Sounds. ex 念出數字以記住電話號碼  
* Semantic: Meaning.  

### Enrich Encoding: Improving Memory  

* Elaboration: 聯想其他東西  
* Visual Imagery  
* Self-Referent Encoding: 與自身相關  

## Storage  

Holding the information in memory; Consolidation(加強，整合)  
**Atkinson-Shiffrin** model: three systems  

### Sensory memory  

感覺記憶  
* 保持非常短時間(<1s)  
* 視覺、聽覺、觸覺  
* 要測驗的話要注意不能給實驗者看太久，不然就會用其他方式記憶。  

### Short-term memory  

* 容易被干擾、中斷而影響  
* 5~9 chunks/digits  
* Group familiar stimuli as a single unit. ex: FBICNNCATIBM  
* Rehersal: Repetitively verbalizing or thinking about  
    * Maintenance Rehearsal: Repeat info without thinking about its meaning  
    * Elaborative Rehearsal: Link new info with existing memories and knowledge  
* As "Working memory". **Baddeley**:  
    * Phonological loop: 聽覺+重複念, buffer cache  
    * Visuospatial sketchpad: 視覺, buffer cache  
    * Central executive system: 中央控制  
    * Episodic buffer: userspace buffer  
    * 基本上就是中央控制(CPU)接上了兩個裝置聽覺、視覺，各自有buffer cache，然後用buffered I/O讀寫，之後再存到長期記憶(硬碟)  

### Long-term memory  

Flashbulb memories: 對重大事件會有生動、詳細的記憶 ex: 921, 911, 0403  
* Explicit (declarative) Memory: conscious  
    * Semantic Memory 語意  
    * Episodic Memory 事件  
* Implicit (procedural) Memory: unconscious  
    * learned skills. ex: riding a bike.  

## Retrieval  

Recalling info, reconstructing memories, produce info in a form silimar to what was encoded.  

### Game  
Write down 2 words for each of 12 things.  

:::spoiler clues  
1. adolescent: young, acne  
2. cheese: holes, yellow  
3. spider: legs, bugs  
4. glass: transparent, container  
5. stomach: acid, digestion  
6. art: painting, Mona lisa  
7. country: Taiwan, Ukraine  
8. apple: red, bad  
9. jeans: long, blue  
10. bike: transportation, NTU  
11. noise: Gaussion, sound  
12. school: NTU, CKSH  
:::  

It's hard to recall them all(maybe 5~9 due to short-term memory) without see the clues, but it's very easy with the clues. This shows the effects of context cues(may be associated with personal experience).  

### Misinformation effect  

Memory may be misled be post-event info. Since post-event info occured more recent.  

# Forgetting  

Retention: the proportion of meterial remembered.  
Three types of tasks:  
* Recall: Recall something without clues(harder). Unlimited  
* Recongnition: Identify information that you have previously learned. Larger than recall.  
* Relearning: Learn again and check if you learn faster. Memories are there even if we can't recall them.  

## Why we forget?  

### Decay Theory  

Memory fades with time if not accessed, usually converges to > 0  

### Interference Theory  
* Proactive Interference  
換密碼後就但還是以為是舊密碼  
* Retroactive Interference  
舊知識被新知識干擾  

### Intended  
People protect themselves by forgetting  
unwanted memories.  

# Improving memory  

* Pay attention  
* Create retrival cues  
* Minimize interference  
* Touch the memories
